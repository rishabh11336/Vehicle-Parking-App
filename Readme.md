### Overview

The Vehicle Parking App streamlines the management of parking operations, allowing for real-time space availability tracking, automated fee calculation, and robust reporting for both administrators and users[1][2][3].

***

### Features

- **Real-Time Parking Space Availability**: See which slots are currently available or occupied across all lots.
- **Parking & Exit Logging**: Register vehicles, log entry/exit times, and maintain historical records.
- **Automated Cost Calculation**: Fees are computed based on parking duration and vehicle type, with clear invoicing.
- **User Roles**: Supports admin, staff, and customer user roles with appropriate access controls.
- **Space Booking**: Users can search for, book, and reserve spots in advance.
- **Payment Integration**: Supports credit card or e-wallet payments for seamless checkout.
- **Parking History**: Users and admins can access historical logs of all vehicles and transactions.
- **Analytics & Reports**: Generate reports on usage, revenue, and occupancy trends.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile- and desktop-friendly experience.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT/OAuth2-based login for all users.

***

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Vue Router, Vuex, Axios
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI), SQLAlchemy/ORM, RESTful APIs
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL (configurable)
- **Others**: Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

***

### Architecture

- **Frontend**:
  - User Dashboard: Book spots, view status, pay, review history
  - Admin Dashboard: Manage lots, generate reports, manage users
- **Backend**:
  - RESTful endpoints for all park operations
  - Auth middleware for JWT/OAuth2
  - Database layer abstracted for portability
- **Deployment**: Dockerized microservices architecture for scalable deployment
